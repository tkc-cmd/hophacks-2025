Medication Therapy Management (MTM): Pharmacists can conduct comprehensive reviews of all your medications—including prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and supplements—to check for potential drug interactions, side effects, and to ensure the regimen is safe and effective.

Medication Synchronization ("Med Sync"): This service simplifies managing multiple prescriptions by aligning all of a patient's refills to be ready on the same day each month. This reduces the number of trips to the pharmacy and helps improve medication adherence.

Patient Counseling: Pharmacists provide detailed instructions on how to take a new medication, discuss potential side effects, and offer advice on general health concerns.

Chronic Disease Management: Pharmacists can assist patients in managing chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, and asthma by providing education and ongoing support.

Prescription Transfers: They can help you transfer your prescriptions from another pharmacy to consolidate all your medications in one location.

Prior Authorizations: Pharmacies often work directly with insurance companies and doctors to handle prior authorization requests, which are required for some medications to be covered by insurance.

Home Delivery: Many pharmacies offer services to deliver medications directly to a patient's home, which is especially useful for those with mobility issues or busy schedules.

Safe Drug Disposal: Pharmacies often have designated drop-off locations for the safe and proper disposal of unwanted or expired medications, preventing them from being misused or contaminating the environment.

Compounding: This is a specialized service where pharmacists create custom medications tailored to an individual's specific needs. This can involve adjusting a medication's strength, changing its form (e.g., from a pill to a liquid for a child), or removing a nonessential ingredient to which a patient is allergic.
